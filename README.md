# Employee Tracker

This application enables a user to create their own employee tracker using a basic Node.js application. A user is able to add and view employees, roles, and departments. A user is also able to update an employee's role. All data that the user has entered or manipulated is continually synced to a local MySQL database for easy integration with other systems.

Additionally, a schema file and seed SQL file are present in the repository can be used to set up the database and tables with sample data so you can hit the ground running!
